# Project Overview: Virtual Reconstruction of an Etruscan Stele

## Description
This Unity project aims to create a virtual and physical reconstruction of an Etruscan stele, the Vicchio Stele, with a focus on the translation of its inscriptions and the visualization of its original context. The project consists of three main sections.

## Section 1: 3D Model in Context
This section uses software to create a 3D model of the stele and its surroundings based on existing data and research. The virtual environment accurately represents the context of the stele, including the landscape and other artifacts found in the area. Stable Diffusion is used to create a transition between the two contexts (if applicable).

## Section 2: Inscription Translation
The inscriptions on the stele are simulated translated through projections.

## Section 3: Virtual Reality Experience
This section utilizes VR technology to provide users with an immersive experience of the stele and its context. The VR experience allows for a more engaging and educational experience for users.

## The Stele
The Etruscan stele is a significant historical artifact that dates back to the Etruscan civilization. It is a tall, vertical slab of stone that often contains inscriptions, artwork, and other historical information. The aim of this project is to provide users with a deeper understanding of the stele and its context through the use of technology and virtual reconstruction.

## Conclusion
The Virtual Reconstruction of an Etruscan Stele project aims to combine historical research and modern technology to create an engaging and educational experience for users. The use of 3D modeling, inscription translation, and VR technology provides users with a unique perspective on the Etruscan stele and its significance in history.
